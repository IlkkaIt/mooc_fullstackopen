Got an info from University via email that the course Mooc Full Stack will be in the curriculum also 2022, and course info says finished parts are taken into account if you continue the course next year. So im trying to finish as many parts as i can before the deadline in the beginning of the March 2022 and continue from that when next year's course is published.

Wow seems like empty folders cant be pushed to remote or can they? Added subfolders for all ot the coure sections/chapeters and modified readme, but only latter was updated in remote.

Seems like they cant: 

"Currently the design of the git index (staging area) only permits files to be listed, and nobody competent enough to make the change to allow empty directories has cared enough about this situation to remedy it.

Directories are added automatically when adding files inside them. That is, directories never have to be added to the repository, and are not tracked on their own." source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/115983/how-can-i-add-a-blank-directory-to-a-git-repository
