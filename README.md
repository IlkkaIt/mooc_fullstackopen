Got an info from University via email that the course Mooc Full Stack will be in the curriculum also 2022, and course info says finished parts are taken into account if you continue the course next year. So im trying to finish as many parts as i can before the deadline in the beginning of the March 2022 and continue from that when next year's course is published.
